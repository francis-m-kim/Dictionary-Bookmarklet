# Dictionary Bookmarklet

Bring back bookmarklets! This is a simple bookmarklet app that looks up any highlighted word on a webpage.

To use the app, create a bookmark and paste the code from dictionary.js into the URL field. Now, highlight a word on a webpage and click the bookmark. If all goes well, a window containing the definition(s) should appear below the highlighted word. To dismiss the window, click the 'x' button in the upper right corner, or simply click outside the window. You can also hit escape. All instances of the word will now be highlighted. These can be double-clicked to show the definition(s) again. After the bookmarklet has been used once on a page, it is possible to look up a highlighted word by pressing ALT-d.

That's about all there is to the app. Enjoy!

*PS the Pearson dictionary API used by the app is somewhat unreliable. But it's free and you get what you pay for.*
